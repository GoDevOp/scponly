"scponly" is an alternative 'shell' (of sorts) for system
administrators who would like to provide access to remote users to
both read and write local files without providing any remote
execution priviledges.  Functionally, it is best described as a
wrapper to the "tried and true" ssh suite of applications.

NOTE - About a week after writing this, a potential vulnerability
	was discovered in SSH1.  If you're going to use ssh1 
	with scponly, patch it.

A typical usage of scponly is in creating a semi-public account not
unlike the concept of anonymous login for ftp.  This allows an
administrator to share files in the same way an anon ftp setup
would, only employing all the protection that ssh provides.  This is
especially significant if you consider that ftp authentications
traverse public networks in a plaintext format.

Instead of just a single anon user, scponly supports configuring
potentially many users, each of which could could be set up to provide
access to distinct directory trees.  Aside from the installation details
(see INSTALL), each of these users would have their default shell in
/etc/passwd set to "/usr/local/sbin/scponly" (or wherever you choose
to install it).  This would mean users with this shell can neither
login interactively or execute commands remotely.  They can however,
scp files in and out, governed by the usual unix file permissions.

Some Features:
==============

- logging:  scponly logs time, client IP, username, and the actual
request to syslog

- choot: scponly can chroot to the user's home directory (or any 
other directory the user has permissions for), disallowing access 
to the rest of the filesystem.  

- sftp compatibility.  my testing of sftp against an acponly user 
worked great.  this is probably the cleanest and most usable way 
for an scponly user to access files.

- security checks: root login is disallowed (though root
should never be configured to be using scponly as the default shell.)

How it works: 
============= 
If you were to examine the arguments passed to a shell by sshd upon
opening a remote connection, the structure of the argument vector
invariably looks like this:

<shell name> -c <remote command>

scponly validates remote requests by examining the third argument.  
The only commands allowed are "scp" (for ssh1), "sftp-server" (for
ssh2") and "ls".  Arguments to these commands are passed along
unmolested.  scponly also verfies the request by disallowing what a
shell would interpret as "special characters".  This prevents
someone from piggybacking additional commands onto a valid scp
request.  It may seem that using scponly would prevent using scp to
copy files that really do contain special characters.  However,
copying files with special characters in their names can be
accomplished by using wildcards (which are allowable characters) to
match the filenames.

scponly doesnt do anything to manage read/write permissions.  The
ssh applications already do that just fine.  If you use scponly, be
aware that good old unix file permissions are still doing the work
of protecting your files.


MAY 2002 ADDENDUM:
	I've since discovered that ssh.com's commercial ssh offering 
supports BOTH "dummy users" as well as scponly-ish functionality.  I
have not been able to find any notes on these features, but I did read
that they exist.  I will make a point to include more information later.
It appears that OpenSSH does not yet support these features.  At this time,
I have no plans to end-of-life scponly, though ultimately, I recognize
that scponly should eventually become just a feature of whichever sshd 
you may run.
