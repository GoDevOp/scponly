scponly v1.3

feb 6 2002:
	pretty significant code changes to accomplish the following:
		- total overhaul of install scripts.  They are now rather
			BSD centric.  this might cause pain in the linux and
			solaris realms, which I would be happy to try to accomodate
			for.  
		- added clean_request() function to remove some unwanted
			leading path information from shell commands. This
			was in hopes of resolving the openssh client's habit 
			of specifying the full pathname of the sftp-server.
		- added debugging information that can be turned on at run
			time instead of compile time.  see INSTALL for notes
		- chroot() functionality is now established at run time instead
			of compile time as well.  depending on the NAME of the
			scponly binary (scponly/scponlyc), scponly will try to
			chroot.  this allows an admin to configure chroot functionality
			on a per user basis, instead of per host installation.
		- increased the list of acceptable commands for compatibility with
			sftp clients that do stuff like chmod and chown


scponly v1.2

jan 10th 2002:
	applied a patch submitted by dkl at tessellated dot net.

	increases compatibility with wintendo style sftp/scp clients by also
	allowing things like chmod, pwd, etc


scponly v1.1

feb 23rd - 8:36pm EST:

	I've discovered a rather glaring problem with the original release.
	It seems that while implementing chroot() functionality, I completely
	broke the wildcard matching.  This is because "/bin/sh" is required
	to expand wildcards.  

	Though it is undesirable to have ANY command interpretter in the chroot
	path, it should not be possible to invoke sh interactively or remotely.

	This fix vastly increases the usability of scponly.
