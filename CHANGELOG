scponly v2.2
	11 june, 2002

	syslog implementation
		- Andrew Chadwick sent in a patch for syslog implementation
		- scponly now logs properly


scponly v2.1
	5 june, 2002

	chroot bugfix
		- Volker Kindermann <volker@volker.de> contributed a bug report 
			regarding WinSCP and chroot usage.  login sets the 
			interactive market on the binary name so it becomes
			"-scponlyc".  this was confusing the chroot check.
		- fixed setup_chroot to include "groups" binary

 
scponly v2.0
	2 july, 2002

	lots of code added for compatibility with WinSCP 2.0
		- this code actually contradicts the "no interactive commands"
			mandate of scponly.  scponly now DOES support interactive
			commands limited to the commands scponly already allowed
			remote execution of, plus "cd", "groups" and "echo".
		- since this is new, it can be excluded at compile time
		- i havent tested against WinSCP 1.0, as i expect it will go away
			with the advent of WinSCP 2.0
		- upon various failure conditions, WinSCP will probably freak out
			when it receives the error messages from scponly.  check
			your "logging" feature in WinSCP if this starts happening

	install script improved to not append shells to /etc/shells if they are already there
		- watch for this if you CHANGE your shell path and re-install


scponly v1.4
	may 20, 2002
	minor bugfix
		- upon failing to open a logfile, scponly would try to log to logfile.

scponly v1.3

feb 6 2002:
	pretty significant code changes to accomplish the following:
		- total overhaul of install scripts.  They are now rather
			BSD centric.  this might cause pain in the linux and
			solaris realms, which I would be happy to try to accomodate
			for.  
		- added clean_request() function to remove some unwanted
			leading path information from shell commands. This
			was in hopes of resolving the openssh client's habit 
			of specifying the full pathname of the sftp-server.
		- added debugging information that can be turned on at run
			time instead of compile time.  see INSTALL for notes
		- chroot() functionality is now established at run time instead
			of compile time as well.  depending on the NAME of the
			scponly binary (scponly/scponlyc), scponly will try to
			chroot.  this allows an admin to configure chroot functionality
			on a per user basis, instead of per host installation.
		- increased the list of acceptable commands for compatibility with
			sftp clients that do stuff like chmod and chown


scponly v1.2

jan 10th 2002:
	applied a patch submitted by dkl at tessellated dot net.

	increases compatibility with wintendo style sftp/scp clients by also
	allowing things like chmod, pwd, etc


scponly v1.1

feb 23rd - 8:36pm EST:

	I've discovered a rather glaring problem with the original release.
	It seems that while implementing chroot() functionality, I completely
	broke the wildcard matching.  This is because "/bin/sh" is required
	to expand wildcards.  

	Though it is undesirable to have ANY command interpretter in the chroot
	path, it should not be possible to invoke sh interactively or remotely.

	This fix vastly increases the usability of scponly.
