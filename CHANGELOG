scponly v1.1

feb 23rd - 8:36pm EST:

	I've discovered a rather glaring problem with the original release.
	It seems that while implementing chroot() functionality, I completely
	broke the wildcard matching.  This is because "/bin/sh" is required
	to expand wildcards.  

	Though it is undesirable to have ANY command interpretter in the chroot
	path, it should not be possible to invoke sh interactively or remotely.

	This fix vastly increases the usability of scponly.
